Version: From SINVOIOP was Outdated and not SUPPORTED by the current package-systems Linux(Debia/Ubuntu) Deploy!

To fix the installation for Systems builded in time I Hot-Fixed the Installtion-Files.

On Systems which was builded just in time , python2, python2-pip and swig2.0 are outdated and not more available by the package-manager!



Changes:

OLD MAKEFILE:

all: bindings
	python setup.py build

bindings:
	swig2.0 -python wiringpi.i

install:
	sudo python setup.py install



NEW MAKEFILE:

all: bindings
	python3 setup.py build

bindings:
	swig -python wiringpi.i

install:
	sudo python3 setup.py install
